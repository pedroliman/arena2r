# arena2r

[![Travis-CI Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/pedroliman/arena2r.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedroliman/arena2r)

The goal of arena2r is to facilitate the analysis of Arena Simulation Software output in R. This figure illustrates what it does.

![What arena2r does.](arena-2-r-plots.png)

This package will be usefull to you, if:

a) You are an useR;
b) You use Arena Simulation;
c) You dislike Arena's simulation Process Analyzer, or similar tools, and have seen yourself struggling to summarise simulation results by hand at excel;
d) You want to get your Arena Simulation Output directly to R and have a tidy data.frame with all your results to run your analyses there seamlessly.

I have seen myself in this position many times and resolved to put together a package and stop doing repetitive work, so you can get from Arena results to nice plots in seconds, not hours.


## Usage

You can use arena2r online with the demo shiny app at:

https://pedrolima.shinyapps.io/arena2r/

Alternatively, you can install it in your R envinronment.

## Installation

You can install arena2r from github in R with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pedroliman/arena2r")
```

## Use the App locally:

After installing, load the library and run the demo app.

```{r local-usage, eval = FALSE}
library(arena2r)

runArenaApp()

```

## How to use

Please follow the [instructions on this tutorial](https://www.pedronl.com/post/arena2r-package-tutorial/) to use Arena2r.


## Wishlist

<!-- The following functions aren't available in the package, but are desirable. If you're willing to contribute with this package, please considering working on these features. -->

- The package won't run different simulations for you based on a Design of Experiments;
- There is no guarantee that the package will acomodate future changes in the csv format exported by Arena. The package is tested with the Arena 14.00 version;
- The package only uses the standard csv pattern (If you are Brazillian like me, it's easier to change your regional configurations).

Pull requests are welcome.
